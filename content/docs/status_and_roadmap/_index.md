# Status & Roadmap

The first release version, 0.1.0, is now live.  It has a number of known
issues (see the GitHub issue trackers in the relevant repositories)
but we do have example systems that use it such as the [reference
system](/docs/kitty) and [tutorials](/docs/tutorials).

Over the next couple months, our general priorities are:
 1. Improve the experience of building a system using LionsOS. This
    involves improving the build system as well as improving tooling
    to configure and put together components. More information is on
    the [integration page](/docs/use/integration).
 2. Add more documentation and tutorials to this website.
 3. Add a web server example (for hosting this website).

There is a lot of work being done in parallel, a more detailed roadmap
will be published soon.
