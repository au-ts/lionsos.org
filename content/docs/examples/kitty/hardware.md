# Setting up your Odroid-C4 hardware

The example system targets the HardKernel Odroid-C4 platform as it is a fairly inexpensive, accessible, and reliable ARM single-board-computer.

The Odroid-C4 is available for purchase [directly from HardKernel](https://www.hardkernel.com/shop/odroid-c4/).

Official documentation for the Odroid-C4 is available [here](https://wiki.odroid.com/odroid-c4/odroid-c4).

## Connecting everything together

This section will show you how to connect all the hardware pieces you
have to your Odroid-C4.

<!-- TODO: Add link to 3D-printable case -->

### UART

There multiple ways to connect to the UART but in this section we will describe a common and
easy way which is to use a UART to USB adapter like below:

The connection will look like this:

**Your PC <-> USB <-> UART adapter <-> Odroid-C4**

You will connect the UART adapter to your computer via USB.

You will then need a program to read the serial connection on your computer such as minicom, picocom
or a GUI application such as [GTKTerm](https://github.com/Jeija/gtkterm).

For example, to use minicom:
```sh
# Note that the path to the USB device of the UART adapter
# may be different for you
minicom -D /dev/ttyUSB0 -b 115200
```

### Display

The display is fairly easy to connect, at the back you will see a bunch of GPIO inserts which you want
to align with the GPIO pins on the Odroid-C4.

You will then want to connect the HDMI bridge, the HDMI port on the display should line up with the
HDMI port on the Odroid-C4.

### NFC card reader

<img src="/nfc_card_reader.jpeg" alt="PN532 NFC card reader close up" width="300"/>

There are two parts to setting up the card reader:
1. Setting to I<sup>2</sup>C mode.
2. Connecting the GND, VCC, SDA, and SCL pins.

#### Setting to I<sup>2</sup>C mode

We need the NFC card reader to be in I<sup>2</sup>C mode, which means that the DiP need to be
in a certain configuration. For I<sup>2</sup>C, switch 1 needs to be set
and switch 2 needs to be not set. The image below can be used as reference.

#### Connecting the pins

#### With display

Below is a close-up of the back of the right side of the VU7C display. Highlighted in
green are the relevant pins that we need to connect to the NFC reader:

| Display pin | NFC card reader pin |
| ---- | ---- |
| GND  | GND |

### Ethernet

If you want to use the NFS client, you will need to give the Odroid-C4 access to
your NFS server via ethernet.

## Flashing U-Boot

Follow the instructions [here](https://github.com/Ivan-Velickovic/flash_uboot_odroidc4).

<!-- TODO, reproduce the instructions from https://github.com/Ivan-Velickovic/flash_uboot_odroidc4
here.

TODO, have instructions for building custom U-Boot in case the reader needs some specific
config option in U-Boot that isn't in the default one.

TODO, an option is to have a tar.gz that contains the image *as well as* the `uboot.env` file
so that they don't have to configure U-Boot manually. -->

## Configuring U-Boot

When you see this message from U-Boot:
```
Hit any key to stop autoboot:  1
```

You will want to stop the autoboot immediately. From here,
we want to setup the U-Boot environment to automatically load
the system image. There are two main ways of getting system images
into U-Boot:
1. (**recommended**) Booting via the network. Where you have a TFTP server
  on some other computer that transfers the system image to U-Boot
  on the Odroid-C4 via the network.
2. Using a storage device such as an SD card or eMMC.

<!-- TODO, only tested these instructions via SD card, not via eMMC yet. -->

### Option 1 - Booting via the network

By default U-Boot is set to auto-boot into a Linux system, we want to change that obviously.
This can be done by changing the value of the U-Boot environment variable `bootcmd`, the contents
of which is executed automatically when U-Boot starts, unless U-Boot is interrupted.

When you are in the U-Boot console, enter the following commands:

```
=> setenv bootcmd 'dhcp; tftpboot 0x20000000 <SYSTEM IMAGE PATH>; go 0x20000000'
=> saveenv
```

You should see the following output:
```
Saving Environment to MMC... Writing to MMC(0)... OK
```

Note that the `<SYSTEM IMAGE PATH>` will be the path to the system image in your TFTP server.
<!-- (TODO isn't is relative to some root directory of the TFTP server?) -->

From here, you will need to run `saveenv` in order to have the change persist across reboots.

Finally you can reboot your Odroid-C4 and after a couple of seconds it should automatically
boot into your system image.

### Option 2 - Booting from storage
