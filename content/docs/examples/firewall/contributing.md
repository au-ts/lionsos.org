# Contributing to the firewall

Currently the firewall example is in early stages of development, missing many
of the basic features expected of a firewall. We consider this a community
project and are inviting interested people to contribute to it and help improve
its functionality and usability.

We have an extensive list of GitHub
[issues](https://github.com/au-ts/lionsos/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20state%3Aopen%20label%3Afirewall)
we are currently tracking with the firewall, starting from minor improvements to
our implementation. Issues with the firewall example are all tagged with the
`firewall` label. Three other labels are used to categorise the issues:

- `minor improvement`: Refers to an improvement that could be made to the
  firewall with minimal changes and time, often to just one component of the
  system, see
  [here](https://github.com/au-ts/lionsos/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20state%3Aopen%20label%3Afirewall%20label%3A%22minor%20improvement%22).
- `major improvement`: Refers to an improvement that could be made to the
  firewall which would require a larger number of changes, often accross more
  than one class of components, see
  [here](https://github.com/au-ts/lionsos/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20state%3Aopen%20label%3Afirewall%20label%3A%22major%20improvement%22).
- `enhancement`: Refers to an entirely missing functionality of the firewall,
  see
  [here](https://github.com/au-ts/lionsos/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20state%3Aopen%20label%3Afirewall%20label%3Aenhancement).
