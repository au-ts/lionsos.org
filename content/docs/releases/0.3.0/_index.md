### Metaprogram tooling

One of the main issues we found with our current approach to using LionsOS was
the time and effort needed to simply stitch together components into one coherent
system.

For the last couple of months we have been working on providing new tooling to
address this friction and make it easier for people to take our off-the-shelf
components and make their own system.

This release transitions our components and example systems to use that tooling.
Each component no longer has system-dependent information hard-coded into the ELF
via C headers and instead injected after compilation. This way off-the-shelf components
are not dependent on the user's specific system.

This is done via a 'metaprogram', a program written by the user which describes their
system, what components exists, what I/O systems exist, etc.

The tooling is still experimental, and are actively developing it to improve and mature
it.
